# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Prepare all district standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. 

The district school board has determined that there was evidence of academic dishonesty and that the Thomas High School (THS) grades were altered. For this reason we will be replacing the grade data for THS 9th graders with "Nans". 

## Results 
How does replacing the 9t grade scores impact the following: 
- Disctrict level summary
